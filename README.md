# Flickr Photo Downloader

This is a script that will automatically download everything from a public album, photostream, gallery, or camera roll on Flickr.

## Installation

Clone the repo from [here](https://github.com/djharten/FlickrPhotoDownloader.git).

Run ```pip install requirements.txt```

This script is written to be used with Google Chrome. You will need the Chrome WebDriver. Open Chrome and go to Menu -> Help -> About Google Chrome to find what version of Chrome you are on, then download the driver from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).

## Usage

Run ```python driver.py``` and follow the prompts. You will need to enter the URL for the Flickr album you wish to download(include "https://' and do not include the "pageX" along with it).

Pull requests are welcome. This was a personal project I used to learn a little more about writing scripts in Python.
